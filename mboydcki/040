 HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.  By Brahma!  let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay.  Jimmini, what a squall!  Well done!  aye!  Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy!  Spell oh!--whew!  God!  and only this evening--it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine--that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him!  Knife thee heartily!  little Pip!  in top-gallant sails!  Blood!  may your hearts never fail!  Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we'll have one of those fine whales, Hand, boys, over hand!  (LEAPS TO HIS FEET.) 

ST.  (QUIETLY SMOKING) That's a white man; he calls that fun: humph!  Merry-mad!  hip!  to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews!  Lord help such jollies!  OATHS A-PLENTY.)  None.  Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankind--devilish dark at that.  Who's afraid of black's afraid of me!  so long as thou crackest, thou holdest!  Pip!  green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite.  In that ring Cain struck Abel. 

2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR.  Aye; girls and a green!--then I'll hop with ye; yea, turn grasshopper!  Fair play!  boys, it'll be douse sail soon.  Bang it, bell-boy!  d'ye hear, bell-boy?  Split jibs!  there goes the jib-stay!  At 'em again!  Blang-whang!  Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.  I don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my taste.  I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over.  I must have partners!  Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it!  Snatch the Spaniard's knife!  Hark ye, lad--fleet interlacings of the limbs--lithe swayings--coyings--flutterings!  lip!  a row!  the ringed horizon.  Eight bells there, forward!  O Christ!  shirr!--but spoken of once!  Jig it, men, I say; merry's the word; hurrah!  shirr!  jump, my jollies!  heart!  here comes the music; now for it!

TAHITAN SAILOR.  Crish, crash!  low veiled, high palmed Tahiti!  Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that.  But there they go, all cursing, and here I don't.  I'll dance over your grave, I will--that's the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners.  We sing; they sleep--aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts.  Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none but the crew's cursed clay.  The squall!  but that old man's a grand old cove!  Jinglers, you say?--there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.  Crack, crack, old ship!  big frame, small spirit!  There!  this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm--give us a whiff, Tash.  Partners!  hurrah with your tambourine!  Stand by all legs!  Stand by for reefing, hearties!  Stand by to reef topsails!  Strike the bell eight, thou Pip!  Tell me not of it!  No?  No; Daggoo showing his teeth.  Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!--the Heeva-Heeva!  tear yourselves!  not taste, observe ye, else come satiety.  Plunge in with ye!  Yes.  Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there's another in the sky--lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.  Fine prospects to 'em; they're on the road to heaven. 

Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!  I've the sort of mouth for that--the hogshead mouth.  Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears.  Now would all the waves were women, then I'd go drown, and chassee with them evermore!  Our captain's commanded.-- 1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR.

That Spaniard's mad or drunk.  While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!  Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!  Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee's peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?--The blast!

Aye!  a row!  all graze: unceasing touch and go!  Me too; where's your girls?  Damn me, won't you dance?  Who'd go climbing after chestnuts now?  Why then, God, mad'st thou the ring?  Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.  He has his orders, mind ye that.  Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal yard!

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.  Ah!  the blast!  It's the waves--the snow's caps turn to jig it now.  But those chaps there are worse yet--they are your white squalls, they.  What's that I saw--lightning?  A row!  Oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the digestion!  There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em through it.  He wants to bully, ah!--the old grudge makes me touchy (ADVANCING.)  White skin, white liver!  So, be cheery, my lads!  I'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject; but excuse me.  How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky?  Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do?  What of that?  What say ye?  Take a tonic, follow me!  I'm quarried out of it!  But that can't be, or else in his one case our old Mogul's fire-waters are somewhat long in working.  There comes the other watch. 

SPANISH SAILOR.  Hist, boys!  Up, spine, and meet it!  How the sea rolls swashing 'gainst the side!  I'm used to ice-floors.  He's no more afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!  I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol--fire your ship right into it!  The mate there holds ye to it stiffly.  They'll shake their tassels soon.  I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid!  Ah me!--not thou nor I can bear the change!  Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us.  Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as you scholars have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it.  So, so, (THRUSTS HIS HEAD DOWN THE SCUTTLE,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!  I mark this in our old Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping to others.  Ready formed.  No offence.  I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat!  Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!  Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!  Throw yourselves!  I save my sweat.  It's worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of the year!  A row!  Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!  A row a'low, and a row aloft--Gods and men--both brawlers!  The sky-born, high-tide Ganges turned to wind!  Sweet work, right work!

OLD MANX SAILOR.  Eight bells there!  A ring, a ring!  Hoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon.  This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea.  Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses.  Tell 'em it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment.  There's naught so sweet on earth--heaven may not match it!--as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.  Eight bells there below!
