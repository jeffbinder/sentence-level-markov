In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts.  Certain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.  In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.  But after embattling his facts, an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy?  Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery?  Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. 

Think of that, ye loyal Britons!  How they use the salt, precisely--who knows?  we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff! 

But the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil is used at coronations?  What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?  There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a castor of state.  As a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality. 

It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through.  Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.
