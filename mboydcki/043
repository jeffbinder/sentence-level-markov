"HIST!  the bucket!" 

"Caramba!  have done, shipmate, will ye?  did you hear that noise, Cabaco?" 

"Hist!  It's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else.  I heard Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind." 

"Cough be damned!  what noise d'ye mean?" 

"There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over, now!" 

"Tish!  Look to the bucket!" 

"Grin away; we'll see what turns up.  Pass along that return bucket." 

"Take the bucket, will ye, Archy?  Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too.  Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?" 

"Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears." 

"There it is again--under the hatches--don't you hear it--a cough--it sounded like a cough." 

"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you're the chap."  In this manner, they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. 

It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail.  Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet. 

It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the words above.  From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
