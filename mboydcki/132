It was a clear steel-blue day.  By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone!  Wife and child, too, are Starbuck's--wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age!  Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us! 

But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.  Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail.  From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop. 

Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's forehead of heaven. 

"Sir."  Aye, and rust amid greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut swaths--Starbuck!" 

"Starbuck!"  that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea!  About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again." 

"Oh, my Captain!  my Captain!  wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive!  bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?  Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?  Forty--forty--forty years ago!--ago!  God!--crack my heart!--stave my brain!--mockery!  Close!  is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under me?  No, no; stay on board, on board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick.  She promised that my boy, every morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's sail! 

"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!  mockery!  noble soul!  grand old heart, after all!  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise.  How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again!  Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  I have seen them--some summer days in the morning. 

But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that distinguished them.  When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without--oh, weariness!  we head for Nantucket!  Away with me!  stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God.  Forty years of continual whaling!  Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow--wife?  Away!  forty years of privation, and peril, and storm-time!  And all the time, lo!  the boy's face from the window! 

But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil. 

Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around.  The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson's chest in his sleep. 

Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small, unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.  Sweet childhood of air and sky! 

Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!  Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes!  the boy's hand on the hill!" 

"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare?  Why this strife of the chase?  Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.  But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.  But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike.  But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. 

"They have, they have.  Where do murderers go, man!  Sleep?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  why should any one give chase to that hated fish!  see yon Albicore!  heaviness!  let us fly these deadly waters!  Oh, Starbuck!  what a forty years' fool--fool--old fool, has old Ahab been!  Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore. 

Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom.  On such a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first whale--a boy-harpooneer of eighteen!  But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck?  Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!  See, see!  it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.  Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his prey--more a demon than a man!--aye, aye!  let us home!  it is done!  Look!  God!  forty years on the pitiless sea!  That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless.  But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain. 

Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.  That hazard shall not be thine.  I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket." 

"Oh, Starbuck!  how the richer or better is Ahab now?  why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?  Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. 

Ahab turned.  No, no!  how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe! 

Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there.  Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm?  Yes, yes!  this is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.  And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.  Behold.  God!  for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep!  who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish?  Sleeping?  let us away!--this instant let me alter the course!  no more!  not with the far away home I see in that eye!"
