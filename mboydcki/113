With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. 

"Look ye here, then," cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look ye here--HERE--can ye smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.  In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad.  Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea." 

"Horse-shoe stubbs, sir?  forge me the harpoon.  I'll blow the fire." 

"Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one." 

"And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?" 

"Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth, resting for a moment on his hammer; "I am past scorching; not easily can'st thou scorch a scar." 

"And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard usage as it had?"  muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle.  While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab. 

For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them. 

When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. 

Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.  Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?  Said I not all seams and dents but one?" 

"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!"  A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  Quick!  deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood. 

At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine.  rejecting the last one.  "Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses." 

"Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray till--but here--to work!"  holding it high up.  jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. 

At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face. 

"Oh!  wincing for a moment with the pain; "have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?" 

"For the white fiend!  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work." 

"Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it." 

"Well, well; no more.  How can'st thou endure without being mad?  Ahoy, there!  that is the one, sir!  Oh, Pip!  Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?" 

"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.  But, away with child's play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day.  Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"  "A flaw!"  Answer!  they are always flying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here, they burn; but thou--thou liv'st among them without a scorch." 

"Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.  Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--What wert thou making there?" 

"Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth?  There's the stuff," flinging the pouch upon the anvil. 

"Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles!  And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line.  But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself, man.  Look ye here!"  thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!  What say ye, pagans!  Quick!  and now for the seizings."  "That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan." 

"Would'st thou brand me, Perth?"  Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, "Good!  Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?"  "Work that over again, Perth."  "I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.  But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside. 

"What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" 

"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers. 

This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.  But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard.  Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to me.  As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. 

"I think so, sir." 

Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron.  This done, pole, iron, and rope--like the Three Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.
